After some contribution from Andrew, we decided to sum power to make more contributions than just MR and we create one task (issue) based from the first MR from Andrew (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues/1644).

In the same time I decided to contribute in the new MR, about a toast at configurations at App section in Settings, this needed to be add because when you remove any configuration from any app we didn't have any feedback to the final user. 

First I decided to see how the Toast component was create in other sections, so I used as a example the Toast used when a background image was deleted.

So I added a list for the itens deleted and create the component with `AdwToast` to show the information, create 3 more functions, where one is to render the Toast the others 2 are to treat the callbacks from the toast bottoms.
